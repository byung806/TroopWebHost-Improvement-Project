# TroopWebHost Improvement Project

This software project aims to create a streamlined email system and better manage troop data in TroopWebHost (TWH), a platform that allows each Boy Scout Troop leader to manage their troopâ€™s adult training and events. Each Boy Scout troop leader has to update the trainings for Boy Scouts volunteers (adults) manually, and our project will improve the convenience and efficiency of the process of managing adults in the troop.
